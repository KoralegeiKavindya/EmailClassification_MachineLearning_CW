## Introduction
This project is  for 2nd year 2nd Semester Coursework required for the Machine Learning Module for the AI&amp;DS Degree offered by the Robert Gordon Universityr, UK

## Purpose
This Project will be used to perform a simple classification problem to label emails as spam or non-spam based on their content in terms of words used.

## Dataset
The dataset for the project has been taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase

## ML Models Used
K Nearnest Neighbours(KNN) and Decision Tree Machine Learning models are used to achieve the above mentioned goal of email classification.
